# Python Regression Program
This program takes in user input, allowing the user to input data points, and then it gives them the line of best fit of those points. It also plots the points and draws the line of best fit on a graph.

**Instructions**:
>To use the program, first enter the number of data points you have. Then enter those points in the following way: x-coordinate,y-coordinate. The program will take those points and give you a line of best fit equation. It will also plot the points on a graph as well as the line of best fit. You can use this information to represent data with a linear equation, which can then be used to predict values that may not be displayed on the plot. The line of best fit is determined by the correlation between the two variables on a scatter plot. This program can be used to predict things in many sectors.
